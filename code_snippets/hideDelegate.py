Hide delegate

Key to good modular design is encapsulation. This means that modules need to know less about other parts
of the system. This makes swaping out or changing other parts of the system easier because fewer modules need to 
be told about the change.

Something to note, when we speak of encapsulation, most of the time we think just hiding our fields but this extends further
the more we understand OOP.
