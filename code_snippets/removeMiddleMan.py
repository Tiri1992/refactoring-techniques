Remove middle man

This is the inverse of `Hide delegate`. One of the downsides of the `hide delegate` method is that everytime a client requires a new feature
of the delegate, we need to add a delegating method to the server class. The server class acts like a `middle man`, sometimes its just more sensible
to have the client calling the delegate directly.
